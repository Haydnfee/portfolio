				<h3>Process and Techniques</h3>

				<p class="featuredTextTitle featuredText">
					 Before i get into this, i'd like to note that i cannot take credit for this as it was shown in a Youtube video (I cannot find a link back as this was a few monthes back).
					 This is currently on my portfolio as a proof of concept.<br>
					 Starting with the base star layer i used noise filters and level adjustments. One set is used to create the majority of stars and the other to create the larger stars, which
					 is then copied and blurred slightly to simulate light. Next i made two layers to create the nebula. First is a render>cloud layer set to color dodge and bellow that, 
					 is my brush layer. Here is where we can play with the mood of the image by using different color pallettes. I picked a cool blue pallette and used soft low opacity brushes
					 to fill out the image. Now i used a dodge tool to highlight some of the brighter areas to create depth. The brush should be set to a very low exposure (10% give or take) so
					 the color isnt blown out.
					 I took a NASA image of a planet and picked a section of it which i then spherized to create a planet. An outer glow which matches the color of
					 the planet is then added which simulates atmosphere. After making a selection of the planet, i feathered the selection and filled it in with black at a slightly lower opacity and 
					 made the current layer off center to make the shadow.
					 To finish the image i rendered a lens flair behind the planet. Some people like this, others dont. I think it works with this image as it will cover any pixelation in the planet made
					 as a side effect of spherize.

				<h3 class="featuredTextTitle">Why</h3>

				<p class="featuredText">
					I began researching better ways of making nebulas and varying stars. Older methods i previously used became tedious and lighting Techniques
					looked flat and cartoonish. I find it relaxing to make space scenes, there are no limits or rules to
					making it look realistic.
