				<h4>The Project</h4>

				<p class="featuredTextTitle featuredText">
					At the begining of my 2nd year in college, the classes were split into dev groups. This website is one of the reasons. Our task was to create a website for the LEDC
					(London Economic Development corporation) in order to promote the growing technological industry within the city. Our teams goal was to create a site to advertise life in
					the city and for business owners/recruiters to post job openings. Bellow are descriptions of each page and the design process that went into them.
				</p>

				<h4>Home</h4>
				<div class="featuredImg">
					<img src="images/LEDCdesktop1.png" alt="Home page">
				</div>
				<p class="featuredText">
					First of is the landing page. I was looking for something modern. I knew i wanted it single page, bold, with a large smoothe font. The team decided to go with a large 
					non-traditional button nav as the content as this landing page wasnt really meant for content, just a welcome screen. Through out the site, the nav then changes to a dropdown
					menu. I find this helps the site look clean and spacious. Just a static landing page would feel boring, so when hovering over the buttons the image trasitions into a darkened animated
					gif. The nav has one thing that wont route to the site, and thats transportation. I thought "when i was new to living here, what was the thing i needed to know" and that was
					bus routes. Since that resource is dynamic and not in our control, i figured it'll be easer to just link to the LTC's bus schedules.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Dynamic Job Posting</h4>
				<div class="featuredImg">
					<img src="images/LEDCdesktop2.png" alt="job postings">
				</div>
				<p class="featuredText">
					Time for the main draw of the site. We wanted a style similar to a localized LinkedIn where an admin could post a job and users could then apply to the admin's post.
					At the top of the page there is a sort by dropdown menu. This may be used as filters for position, type of job ect... The triangular isometric background is used to tie the 
					logo design in with the page to give brand identity to the site. The UI is made to be large and simple to make navigation faster.
				</p>

				<h4>Life in London</h4>
				<div class="featuredImg">
					<img src="images/LEDCdesktop3.png" alt="life">
				</div>
				<p class="featuredText">
					The next 2 screens move away from the business aspect and focus more on actually living in London. This page would feature things that potential homeowners would like to know.
					Housing prices, restaurants, education. The list goes on. Large images are automatically blurred with captions overlayed ontop, the smaller images will blur and display text
					on hover to make the page more dynamic and feel interactive without requiring any extensive code.
				</p>

				<h4>Attractions</h4>
				<div class="featuredImg">
					<img src="images/LEDCdesktop4.jpg" alt="attractions">
				</div>
				<p class="featuredText">
					The final page is to advertise some of the attractions such as the Western Fair and Budweiser Gardens. I felt this would be a strong section of the site as it can link away
					to some of the events going on in the city. Sports and concerts would likly be the major draw. It features an click through slide show of various locations with descriptions.
					As it's focused on being a modern site, transparent images are used to give depth rather then flat image scrolling.
