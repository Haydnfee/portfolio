				<h4>Concept</h4>
				<p class="featuredTextTitle featuredText">
					I wanted to create a whimsical, surreal image. A scenic image that incorperated the the elements of a sci-fi space scene, and that gave the feeling of isolation while
					still being bright and warm. One of the best place for free space photos that i've found is NASA. It's likely the best source currently for high res photos of planets and star clusters.
					The rest of the stock was taken from Pexels.com.</p><br>

					<h4>Background</h4>

					The first challenge is the sky. In this kind of image, it's what sets the tone for the rest of the picture. Thus, special attention goes into tweeking it. We have two options
					to help build this. First we could use cloud rendering. All though i love this tool, cloud stock photos give us much more detail and lighting. The renderer is a bit to clumsy since
					the sky is the key element. Two layer groups go into the sky, the sky itself and the clouds. I took a star filled night photo and placed it as the bottom layer. This will also be
					the lowest layer in the composition. It give's something for the cloud layer to throw light onto. Without it, the clouds would be blown out. I took cloud stock with high amounts of
					contrast. The ligher parts will provide an indirect light source and the darker areas will allow the star background to show through. The image i chose happened to have alot of blues
					and greens so not much editing had to be done, but a color overlay could work on a whiter image too. I then created a copy of that layer. The bottom cloud layer is set to a linear
					light blend mode to enhance color and contrast, then the top layer is set as overlay. The overlay will enhance the brighter colors, thus giving the sky more of a glow effect which adds
					to the whole "magical" feel. To fill in the sky, i cut out a photo of Saturn from a photo from NASA and added a greenish blue color balance. The second "faded" planet to the right is simply
					a dark red elipse set to screen which makes the planet look distant. All the image needed now is a primary light source before i start the foreground. This is made with a blue soft brush and
					a smaller white brush, then lightly blurred. Once i have the sky to my liking, i cut out a calm ocean photo and simply layered it overtop. Ill come back to this ocean layer later to add detail.<br>
				</p>

					<h4>Foreground</h4>
					<div class="featuredImg">

				<p>
					With the environment and light sources created, i needed a foreground. Adding to the surreal feeling, i decided on a small wooden bridge leading to an island. Thankfully, the stock hill photo i had
					already had a tree on the top, less time needed for that. The only editing that needed to be done was to warp the hill to make it steeper, and remove the tree's shadow. I Cut the bridge
					into the scene and added blur as the original photo had many spots like grass, dirt, and jagged edges that i wanted to hide. Later on i added a girl onto the island as a little extra detail.
					The horizon on the left side looked sparse at this point, and i didnt want any major objects which would crowd the composition. A lighthouse in the distance adds a minor detail that
					will add to the photo and not draw the eye away from any of the major components.<br>
				</p>

					<h4>Lighting and Adjustments</h4>
					<div class="featuredImg">
						<img src="images/05.jpg" alt="Home page">
					</div>
				<p>
					I created a cloud render and add a threshhold adjustment, this adds a pure white/pure black contrast. I gave that layer a radial blur focused on the main star, and changed that to soft
					light. This created a godrays layer. Now that all the elements are in place and color corrected, i can start shading. Ill use a light cyan for highlighting and black for shadows, both with a soft light blend mode. There's no
					real right and wrong to this step so it doesnt require much explaination. With shading done, all the image needs is something to help tie everything together. With a white/black
					foreground/background, i made a render cloud layer and used a threshold adjustment layer to increase contrast. Then using a radial blur and a soft light blend mode, i created god rays
					which illuminated from the large star. On the ocean's horizon i used a soft scatter brush to create fog and added curves and color balance layers to finish the composition.
